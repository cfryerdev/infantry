Performance and Load Testing using Golang using Yaml files and outputs json results for report consumption.

## But why?
Yeah well I wanted to practice Golang, and see how small and efficient I can make it. Also i have a report viewer I can port to tie it all together. Thats it. Nothing special.

## Execute?
Just to get you started...
```bash
go run main.go  -p ./data/sample.yaml -o ./data/sample.json
```
